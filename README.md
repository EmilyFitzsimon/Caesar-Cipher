# Caesar-Cipher
A caesar cipher that can encode and decode messages.

So, the original code had a seperate decode/encode function. Now shortened to 1 function that does both. Programme has been debugged so spaces/numbers/symbols can(SHOULD)
be able to be entered without much issue. Also the option of repeating the programme for numerous attempts until you tell it to stop.
